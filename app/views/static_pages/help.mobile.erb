	<b>What is a findpost?</b><br>

	Findposts use searchable criteria called "skales" to allow people to describe a person or thing that they want others to find.

<p>
	<b>Suggested "Skales":</b><br>
	1. Purpose<br>
	2. Location<br>
	3. Time<br>
	4. Goal<br>
	5. Interests<br>
	6. Condition<br>
	8. Qualification<br>
	9. Personality<br>
	10. Additional Information<br>
