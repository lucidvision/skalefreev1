<h1>About</h1>
<p>
	Skalefree.net is a social discovery tool designed to connect people in the most efficient and effective manner. 
	<br><br>
	We live our lives surrounded by people, and yet, we only interact with a tiny portion of them. Here at skalefree, we strive to help people find those they need in their lives. Whether you're simply looking to sell a textbook, chat with people in your classes, or even find a new friend that shares your interests, Skalefree provides the tools you need to meet your goals!
	<br><br>
	<b>Skalefree connects people in two ways: Findposts and Wallposts.<br><br>
		Findposts help students find people for a specific purpose.<br><br>
		Wallposts help students share their thoughts with different SFU communities.<br><br>
